# MineGL

Welcome to MineGL! This project aims to make a classic Minecraft-clone, but using only WebGL, with no other libraries.


## Link

You can play MineGL by following [this link](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-minegl/).

Please note that the canvas resizes itself at the start of the page. So, if your canvas is too small, try to maximaze your browser window, then press F5 on the keyboard to reload the webpage.


## Instruction

* Use W-A-S-D to move around, and spacebar to jump.
* To move your head click with the mouse left button somewhere on the canvas, then move your cursor.
* Time passes by itself, but if you want to make it faster, press the T key. This will make the sun and the moon change their position in the sky, and also will change the sunlight color.
* Please note that you can move and look around at the same time. You can even actually do all of the above at the same time
